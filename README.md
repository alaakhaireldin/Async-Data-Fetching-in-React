Async Data Fetching in React: An Interruptible and Optimized Implementation with AbortController, Custom Hooks, and Error Handling

I developed this project to showcase my expertise in working with asynchronous data fetching in a React application.

It includes my implementation of an interrupt button to cancel ongoing fetch requests, the use of AbortController to cancel requests on component unmount, and the handling of errors while fetching data.

Additionally, I have demonstrated proficiency in creating a custom fetch hook, utilizing useState to display loading text, and using useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

The useEffect hook is used to fetch data with a dependency array and control when the effect should run.

The project also makes use of JSON server to simulate a back-end service and was initiated using Create React App.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
